Welcome to the doctor's office program by Jai SINGH ic22b037!

A working version of the program is in the docsoffice/src_final folder. The final tests are located in docsoffice/unittests_final. 
These two directories are the most important. Ignore other files outside of those folders.

The username and password for the administrator is hardcoded and is "admin" "admin. The user saving doesn't work yet.

In the playground folder there are numerous tests. Most of the tests are located in the folder docsoffice/playground/finalTests and /pat_queue. The program in the src folder is compiled via compile.sh which includes all necessary .c files and other arguments. The implemented and tested functions are everything but waitingRoom.c and waitingRoom.h. Those files are still under construction. In docsoffice/playground/finalTests it almost works but is still a bit buggy.

ToDo: User-Login doesnt work after restart. File saves with blank line as well. Seating arrangement and priority call. Bugfix: Rows and Colums get always written into .csv again. Seachfunctions dont find old patients?!
