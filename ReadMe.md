Welcome to the doctor's office program by Jai SINGH ic22b037!

The program is in the docsoffice folder. In the playground folder there are numerous tests while in the src folder there are the main functions. Most of the tests are located in the pat_queue test folder. The program is compiled via compile.sh which includes all necessary .c files. The implemented and tested functions are anything but seats.c and seats.h. Those files are still under construction.

ToDo: Seating arrangement and priority call.
